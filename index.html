---

# Shapefiles
--
        
+ Basic file for storing map elements
--

+ Stores spatial data, like points, lines, and polygons
--

+ Multiple files comprise a "shapefile"

--

![img-center-80](images/file_struct1.png)

---

# Shapefiles

![img-center-80](images/file_struct1.png)
--

+ .shp—The main file that stores the feature geometry
--

+ .dbf—The dBASE table that stores the attribute information of features

---

# Shapefiles

![img-center-80](images/file_struct1.png)

+ .prj—The file that stores the coordinate system information
--

+ .shx—The index file that stores the index of the feature geometry

---

# You might also see
--

+ .cpg—Identifies the character set to be used
--

+ .sbn and .sbx—The files that store the spatial index of the features

---

# Shapefiles

+ Have a few limitations
--

+ One geometry type (Point, Line, Polygon) per shapefile
--

+ So sometimes you end up with this
![img](images/file_struct2.png)

---

# Shapefiles
--

+ Column names can only be letters, numbers, and underscores "_"
--

+ Column names can only be ten characters long

# 5 Data Analytics Tasks
???
+ Facilitator introduces the 5 main tasks of analysis
+ Facilitator reminds participants we've talked about these in previous courses
+ We're going to look at these in a GIS
--

1. Filtering
--

1. Sorting
--

1. Aggregating
--

1. Transforming
--

1. Visualizing

---

# Data Analytics Tasks: Filtering
+ We can filter the points based on the values in the attribute table

---

# Data Analytics Tasks: Filtering
+ Right-click on the layer and select "Filter" to open the Query Builder

![img-center-55](images/qgis-filter-0.png)

---

# Data Analytics Tasks: Filtering

---

# Does this look familar?

```
"Complaint Type" = 'Root/Sewer/Sidewalk Condition'
```
--

## It's very similar to the format for an SQL `WHERE`

---

# Data Analytics Tasks: Filtering

# Zoom to Layer
![img-center-100](images/qgis-zoom-1.png)

---

# Zoom Selection
--

+ Select the zoom on the toolbar
--

![img-right-30](images/zoom_box.png)
--

+ Draw a box around the area you want to zoom into
--

+ Click the icon to return to the previous map extent
--

![img-right-30](images/extent_box.png)

---

# Pan Map
+ Select the hand tool to pan around the map

![img-center-30](images/hand.png)

# Exporting Data
![img-center-70](images/qgis-export-0.png)

---

# Exporting Data
![img-center-50](images/qgis-export-1.png)

---

# Your Turn
+ Filter for service requests in your boro
+ Try and find something interesting
+ Change the style of the point, either to a different shape, color, or icon
+ Export your selection as a new shapefile

---

class:center,middle
# So what is a Coordinate Reference System?

---

# Projections
--

+ No one's favorite part of GIS
--

+ But a necessary part of it nonetheless
--

+ Convert points on the 3-dimensional Earth (**latitude** and **longitude**) to x and y coordinates on a 2-dimensional map

---

# Projections
+ Every projection distorts some part of your map

![img-center-50](images/projections-faces.png)

[Source _Elements of Map Projection With Applications To Map and Chart Construction_ (public domain material)](https://archive.org/stream/cu31924003898271#page/n58/mode/1up)

---

# Mercator Projections
--

+ A common map projection
--

+ Makes geometries near poles look bigger than geometries near the equator
--

![img-center-50](images/mercator.gif)

---

# Projections Matter
--

+ These circles are all the same size on the globe

---

# Projections Matter
![img-center-100](images/projections.png)

---

# Projections

+ For the most part we will work in **WGS 84** (latitude and longitude)
--

+ In NYC, we use a more accurate projection **NY State Plane/Long Island Zone**
![img-right-60](images/projections_NYSplane.png)

###### Source: https://alidade.wikispaces.com/New+York+SPCS+Zones
---

# Projections
+ Identified by unique IDs that make it easier to talk about them
--

+ WGS 84 is referred to as **EPSG:4326**
--

+ State Plane Long Island is referred to as **EPSG:2263**
--

## Remember these two and you should be set

---

# Selecting Points

---

# Selecting Points - Saving Selection
![img-center-50](images/qgis-select-8.png)

---

# Selecting Points - Saving Selection

+ If we wanted to reproject the data into a different CRS, we could do that here
--
![img-center-60](images/reproject1.png)
--

+ Pick the new projection in the CRS field (like when we imported the CSV)

---

# Data types
--

+ As with databases, columns in the attribute table have data types
--

+ You'll see similar data types as you do in databases

---

# Data types
--

+ integer
--
 - a number with no digits after the decimal point, like `5` or `100349`
--

+ real
--
 - a number with digits after the decimal point, like `5.01` or `100.349`
--

+ string
--
 - text, like `Queens`
--

+ date

---

# When do data types matter?
--

+ When performing calculations&mdash;only numeric (integer or real) columns can be used mathematically
--

+ When styling a layer, some styles require numeric columns

+ QGIS is doing something similar to

```
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM requests_311
GROUP BY boro
```

---

# Your Turn

# Project

+ Work with the group that you formed before lunch
--

+ Explore the data available in the database to work toward answering your group question
--

+ Don't worry about exporting your map yet, we will talk about cartography and Print Layouts next

???
+ Groups work on their projects together for 45-60 minutes
+ Groups should access data in database to try to answer their questions
+ Facilitators work to keep groups moving toward a mappable solution

# Base Maps

+ Adding base maps will give your map context
--

+ In QGIS, you need a plugin to use base maps
--

+ There are several, but we're only going to use one of them

---

# Base Map Plugin
+ From the Plugins menu, select "Manage and Install Plugins"

![img-center-90](images/qgis-plugins-0.png)

# Cartographic principles

---

# Hierarchy
--

+ Make the most important elements of your map look the most important
--

+ Also avoid base maps that strongly emphasize features that aren't relevant on your map

---

# Colors
--

+ Try to use colors to add clarity to your map
--

+ The contrast between different elements on your map should be enough to make each clearly visible

# ArcGIS

+ Parks has a license with Esri, so you can use ArcGIS Desktop and ArcGIS Pro

---

# ArcGIS

+ You have access to many training materials at [Esri Academy](https://www.esri.com/training/)

![img-center-80](images/esri-academy-0.png)

---

# ArcGIS

+ If the training says "Requires Maintenance", the Parks license covers it

![img-center-70](images/esri-academy-1.png)

---

# ArcGIS

+ The Parks license does not cover trainings with dollar amounts next to them

# How does this affect you?

---
exclude:true
# Proprietary vs Open Source Software
+ Proprietary software source code is owned by an individual or an organization and tightly restricted (usually for profit)
+ Open source software source code is freely available to anyone for download, alteration, and republishing

---
exclude:true

# Proprietary vs Open Source Software
+ Proprietary software code is generally supported by a team of paid professionals working for the organization that owns the code
+ Open source software code is generally supported by a mix of paid and volunteer professionals that contribute changes back to the community
---
exclude:true

# Proprietary vs Open Source Software
+ Proprietary software is often available only by purchasing a license
+ Open source software is free to use though there generally a license that specifies the restrictions (if any) on its use and reuse
+ Companies using open source software may charge for the use of the software through their proprietary implementations or via their infrastructure

# A Few Things We Didn't Talk About
--

+ Normalizing data for choropleths ([see this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RvSxNcafU))
--

+ Buffering features
--

+ Geocoding
--

+ Other spatial data types (KML, GeoJSON, GeoTIFF)
--

+ Editing data

---

# QGIS - The Good
--

+ Freely available desktop application
--

+ Lots of features
--

+ Works with different data types
--

+ A strong community developing new features and plug-ins

---

# QGIS - The Bad
--

+ A bit bug-y sometimes
--

+ Visual style is a little clunky
--

+ Features change between versions
--

+ It will crash (but so will ArcGIS)

---

exclude:true
# QGIS - The Good
+ Open-source software that’s freely available
+ Works with lots of different data types, including shapefiles, KML (Google Earth), GeoJSON, and text files
+ Works with various spatial databases
+ Strong community developing features and plug-ins

---

exclude:true
# QGIS - The Bad
+ Not an enterprise software like Esri ArcGIS
+ Features tend to change between versions (moving around, menu option changes, etc) 
+ Major versions tend to have major feature changes
+ Plug-ins don't always work with newer versions
+ And it crashes (as you've probably already experienced)

---

exclude:true
# And of course...
![img-center-80](images/bug.png)

---

exclude:true
# QGIS - The Bug-y
+ Like any software, QGIS has bugs
+ Search sites like [GIS Stack Exchange](https://gis.stackexchange.com/) to see if others have similar issues
+ View and file new bugs on [GitHub](https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues)

# Reminders
--

+ Know your layer CRS
--

+ When in doubt, zoom in and then zoom out
--

+ If you’re working with a CSV file and run into an error, export as a shapefile and try it again
--

+ Save your project often
--

+ Choose good file names

---

# Final Thoughts
--

+ Maps are a great way to visualize and explore spatial data
--

+ Some data is only intelligible when mapped
--

+ QGIS is a cheap (as in free) way to get started 
--

+ There are many resources online for how to use QGIS and other GIS applications
--

+ Share what you know with others -> Data wants to be mapped
