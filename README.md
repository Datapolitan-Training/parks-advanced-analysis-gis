# Advanced Analysis with GIS

## Summary
A one-day class reinforcing the skills necessary to leverage a geographic information system (GIS) to clean, process, and visualize NYC Parks data. The class will introduce key concepts and skills necessary to use a GIS for data analysis, reinforcing the problem ideation and process mapping skills taught in Introduction to Data Analysis. Working collaboratively in small groups, participants will develop an analytical question they explore throughout the class, presenting their data story at the end of class for constructive feedback.

## Target Audience
Employees of all levels of responsibility with a command of Microsoft Excel and SQL for sorting, filtering, aggregating, transforming, and visualizing data to tell a true and compelling story, ideally through Excel for Data Analysis I, Excel for Data Analysis II, and Advanced Analysis with SQL. No familiarity with GIS is necessary for this class as we will be introducing and practicing key concepts in class. Participants should complete Introduction to Data Analysis prior to attending this class for an introduction to problem ideation and process mapping.

## Goals
Introduce key concepts necessary for working with geographic information systems (GIS)
Demonstrate advanced techniques with GIS for data analysis
Reinforce and practice best practices in exploratory data analysis
Reinforce brainstorming, problem ideation, and process mapping skills introduced in previous classes
Practice presenting true and compelling data stories to peers
Cultivate an attitude of curiosity to foster a culture of data-driven inquiry

## Participant Development Areas

**Conceptualizing:** Self-directed collaborative scoping of analytics problem and process

**Skill Development:** Loading, analyzing, and visualizing NYC Parks spatial data

**Integrating:** Investigate context using NYC Parks resources

**Communicating:** Project pitch with content critique in order to foster an entrepreneurial mindset with respect to developing and communicating analytical work

**Language Objective:** Demonstrate proficiency of key data skills with little to no assistance or instruction
